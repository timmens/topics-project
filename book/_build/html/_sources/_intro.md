Introduction
============================

***Topics in Econometrics and Statistics, University of Bonn, 2020 -- Prof. Joachim Freyberger***

In this document I present my submission to the project for the topics class in
econometrics and statistics, due by 13. September 2020.



Problem Description
----------------------------

For the project we have been given a simulated data set and a real data set. For each
data set some of the observed outcomes are held back. The task is to build a model for
each data set on the training set and submit the predictions on the test set.


The following part of this document is structured as follows. At the end of this
section I present a link to my predictions for the respective data sets. In the next
chapter I present the model for the simulated data set. Aftwards I introduce my model
for the stock data set.
