If you want to reproduce my results using my code (see below) you need to transform the RData files to parquet files. This can easily be done, for example, with the [SparkR](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/R/write.parquet.html) package for R. For the project to run I expect the two data files to be located in the folder ``data`` with names ``simulated_data.parquet`` and ``stock_data.parquet``, respectively."

The script [build_project.py](https://github.com/timmens/topics-project/tree/main/codes/build_project.py) runs all scripts that are necessary to produce the predictions. If you want to rerun these codes on your computer open your favorite terminal emulator and run the following line by line (I assume you have at least [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) already installed on your system, otherwise read the note below.)\n",
